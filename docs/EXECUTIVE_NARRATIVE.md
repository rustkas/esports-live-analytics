# HLTV 3.0 Data Supplier: Executive Narrative

## The Opportunity

**eSports is a $1.8B industry growing 15% annually.** Live betting on matches is the fastest-growing segment, but operators face a critical problem: **real-time data is fragmented, delayed, and unreliable.**

HLTV.org is the dominant CS2 statistics platform, but they:
- Don't offer real-time APIs
- Provide no prediction capabilities
- Have no B2B data licensing program

**We are building the data infrastructure that HLTV should have built.**

## What We Do

We capture, process, and predict CS2 match outcomes in **sub-500ms latency**—faster than any competitor.

### Core Capabilities

| Prediction Accuracy | N/A | 70%+ on round outcomes |
| API Uptime | 99% | 99.9% SLA |
